# Adding extensions

JupyterLite reuses the same system of _prebuilt_ extensions as in JupyterLab 3.0+.
Prebuilt extensions are also sometimes called _federated extensions_. In JupyterLab they
can be installed via `pip` and `conda` without rebuilding the whole JupyterLab
application.

All the applications shipped with JupyterLite by default are built with JupyterLab
components. This allows for most of the existing third-party JupyterLab extensions to
also work with JupyterLite.

## Adding new extensions from an environment

### Creating a new environment

The easiest way to add new extensions is to use the JupyterLite CLI in a Python
environment where extensions have already been installed.

You can choose the tool of your choice to manage these dependencies, such as `pip`,
`conda` or `mamba`. For `conda` and `mamba` there are typically defined in
`environment.yml`, and in `requirements.txt` for `pip`.

If you want to build a JupyterLite website locally on your machine, it is preferable to
first create a new environment.

This can be done with the `venv` module:

```bash
python -m venv .
source bin/activate
```

Or with `conda` / `mamba`:

```bash
mamba create -n my-jupyterlite-deployment -c conda-forge python -y
mamba activate my-jupyterlite-deployment
```

### Installing the extensions in the environment

As an example let's use the following `requirements.txt`:

```
jupyterlab-tour
jupyterlab-night
```

This file defines list two extensions, one of them is a theme. Run the following command
to install them:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have `jupyterlab` installed, you can verify they are correctly installed with:

```bash
jupyter labextension list
```

Which should return something similar to the following:

```text
JupyterLab v3.*.*
PREFIX/share/jupyter/labextensions
        jupyterlab-tour  v3.1.4 enabled OK
        jupyterlab-night v0.4.0 enabled OK
```

### Build the JupyterLite website

Now we need to produce the JupyterLite archive that will include these extensions. This
can be done with the following command:

```bash
jupyter lite build
```

When you run `jupyter lite build`, all pre-built extensions in your JupyterLab
environment, e.g. `{sys.prefix}/share/jupyter/labextensions` will be:

- copied to `{output-dir}/extensions`
- have their theme information copied to `{output-dir}/{app/?}theme/`

## The case of Jupyter Widgets and custom renderers

Some extensions like Jupyter Widgets and custom renderers also need a Python package to
be installed at runtime when working with a notebook. This is for example the case with
`ipyleaflet`, `bqplot` or `plotly`.

To install the frontend extensions, simply add it to the list of requirements. For
example continuing from the `requirements.txt` file defined above:

```text
jupyterlab-tour
jupyterlab-night
ipywidgets
bqplot
plotly
```

The end users of your JupyterLite instance will **still need to install** the
dependencies at runtime in their notebooks with the IPython-compatible `%pip` magic:

```py
%pip install -q ipywidgets bqplot plotly
```

which translates to:

```py
import piplite
await piplite.install(["ipywidgets", "bqplot", "plotly"])
```

### Avoid the drift of versions between the frontend extension and the Python package

In some situations, the versions of the packages installed at runtime with
`%pip install` or `piplite.install` might not be compatible with the deployed frontend
extension anymore. This can for example happen when a JupyterLite website was built and
deployed a couple of weeks ago, and new versions of the Python packages were released
since. In that case the frontend extension have not been updated since they are still
available as static files as part of the deployment.

One way to avoid this mismatch is to pin the dependencies more explicitly. For example:

```text
ipywidgets==7.7.0
bqplot==0.12.30
plotly==5.8.0
```

The user-facing code in the notebook will then also have to use the same versions to
stay compatible:

```py
%pip install -q "ipywidgets==7.7.0" "bqplot==0.12.30" "plotly==5.8.0"
```

which translates to:

```py
import piplite
await piplite.install(["ipywidgets==7.7.0", "bqplot==0.12.30", "plotly==5.8.0"])
```

This is unfortunately a little bit brittle but does the job for now. There is chance
this will be improved in future versions of JupyterLite.

Check out the [guide on configuring the piplite URLs](../pyodide/wheels.md) if you want
to have more control on your dependencies.

## How to know if an extension is compatible with JupyterLite?

A good starting point for extensions that _might_ work is the JupyterLab issue
_[Extension Compatibility with 3.0 (#9461)][#9461]_. Additionally, this site
demonstrates a few [extensions](../../reference/demo.md).
