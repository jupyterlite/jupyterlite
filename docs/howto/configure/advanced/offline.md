# Create a JupyterLite archive that can be used offline

It is possible to create a fully self-contained JupyterLite archive with no request to
external services.

## Configure the Pyodide kernel

By default the Pyodide files are fetched from a CDN.

The full Pyodide distribution can be pretty heavy (~180MB), but it's possible to
self-host it.

Use the `--pyodide` flag to specify the Pyodide distribution you would like to use. For
example:

```bash
jupyter lite build --pyodide https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/releases/download/0.22.1/pyodide-0.22.1.tar.bz2
```

```{warning}
Generally, a version of `pyodide_kernel` is likely only compatible with variants of the
_same_ `x.y.z` version against which the release was tested, as both python
and JS APIs are still changing frequently on both sides of the dependency.
```

## Configure Mathjax

By default Mathjax is fetched from a CDN.

To retrieve the static asssets at built time and serve them alongside the main website
assets, make sure to install `jupyterlite-core` with
`pip install jupyterlite-core[mathjax]`.

## Configure the piplite wheels

By default calling `%pip install` or `piplite.install()` downloads and installs packages
from the public [PyPI].

Instead you can configure a list of packages that will be downloaded at _build_ time so
they can be hosted alongside your JupyterLite website.

See [](../../pyodide/wheels.md) for more information.

Concretely that means populating a list of URLs for downloading wheels. A good example
for this is the configuration used for the JupyterLite demo website:
[jupyter_lite_config.json][lite-demo-config]

The relevant part of `jupyter_lite_config.json` is the `piplite_urls` list which looks
like the following:

```json
{
  "PipliteAddon": {
    "piplite_urls": [
      "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/e6/0b/24795939622d60f4b453aa7040f23c6a6f8b44c7c026c3b42d9842e6cc31/fastjsonschema-2.15.3-py3-none-any.whl",
      "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/py2.py3/a/asttokens/asttokens-2.0.5-py2.py3-none-any.whl",
      "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/py2.py3/b/backcall/backcall-0.2.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl",
      "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/py2.py3/b/bqplot/bqplot-0.12.33-py2.py3-none-any.whl",
      "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/py2.py3/c/certifi/certifi-2021.10.8-py2.py3-none-any.whl",
      "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/py2.py3/d/defusedxml/defusedxml-0.7.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl",
      "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/py2.py3/e/executing/executing-0.8.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl",
      "..."
    ]
  }
}
```

Tweak this list based on the packages you would like to serve statically.

## Offline Progressive Web App (PWA)

JupyterLite can be used as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on mobile devices, but also on
desktop.

When JupyterLite is configured to work offline as detailed in this guide, it should be
possible to use JupyterLite as a PWA without any network connection. There might still
be a need for using the app while still connected to the Internet first, so the
underlying Service Worker can cache the assets.

Check out the [Using](../../../quickstart/using.md) guide for more details on how to
install JupyterLite as an application.
