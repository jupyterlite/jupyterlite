# Deploy JupyterLite on a standalone server or locally

Deploying a JupyterLite site requires:

- a copy of the JupyterLite site assets
  - often provided by the `pip`-installable python package `jupyterlite-core`
- an option set of configurations for the site and different apps
  - different options offer trade-offs between reproducibility, build speed, deployment
    size, and end-user performance, privacy, and security

## Get an Empty JupyterLite Site

The minimum deployable site archive contains enough to run all of the default
[applications](./using.md#applications), but no content.

```{hint}
Use of the CLI is optional, but **recommended**. It offers substantially better
integration with other Jupyter tools.
```

To get the [Python CLI](../reference/cli.ipynb) and [API](../reference/api/index.md)
from [PyPI]:

```bash
python -m pip install jupyterlite-core
```

You can also install the CLI from [conda forge] with `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlite-core
```

Or `mamba`:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge jupyterlite-core
```

To build an empty site (just the JupyterLite static assets):

```bash
jupyter lite init
```

By default the JupyterLite website will be placed in the `_output` folder. You can
specific a different with `--output-dir` parameter. For instance:

```bash
jupyter lite build --output-dir dist
```

````{note}
By default the `jupyterlite-core` package does not provide any kernels. If you would like to install one in your environment you would need to install it in your build environment. For example to install the Pyodide kernel for JupyterLite:

```bash
python -m pip install jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel
```

Then make sure to rerun the `jupyter lite build` command.
````

## Customizing the site

By default the JupyterLite site will be empty, but you can customize it by adding your
own content and configuration.

The documentation includes several how-to guides for customizing the site:

- [Adding kernels](../howto/configure/kernels.md)
- [Adding extensions](../howto/configure/simple_extensions.md)
- [Adding content](../howto/content/files.md)

Check out the list of [how-to guides](../howto/index.md) for more information.

## Standalone Servers

Now that the static assets have been built, you can use a plain HTTP server to serve
them and access JupyterLite from a web browser.

Suitable for local development, many languages provide easy-to-use servers that can
serve your JupyterLite locally while you get it working the way you want.

```{warning}
Serving some of the kernels requires that your web server supports
serving `application/wasm` files with the correct headers
```

```{hint}
An HTTPS-capable server is recommended for all but the simplest `localhost` cases.
```

### `jupyter lite serve`

The `jupyter lite serve` command offers either a web server powered by Python's built-in
`http.server` or `tornado`, which is likely to be available if any other Jupyter tools
are installed.

In the same directory, run the following command to start the server:

```bash
jupyter lite serve
```

```{note}
More options are also available such as changing the port and log level.
Check out the help with `jupyter lite serve --help` to learn more.
```

#### Jupyter

If you're already running a [Jupyter Server]-powered app, such as JupyterLab, your files
will be served correctly on e.g. `http://localhost:8888/files`.

#### Python

##### http.server

The `http` module in the Python standard library is a suitably-effective server for
local purposes.

```bash
python -m http.server -b 127.0.0.1
```

If you are using a recently-released Python 3.7+, this will correctly serve
`application/wasm` files for WebAssembly kernels.

#### NodeJS

Most nodejs-based servers will be able to host JupyterLite without any problems. Note,
however, that `http-server` does not support the `application/wasm` MIME type.

## Using a release archive

As an alternative to using the `jupyterlite` CLI, you can also download a release
archive from the [GitHub Releases][releases] page.

Download it an extract it, then use one of the approaches mentioned above to start the
server.

Nightly and work-in-progress archives are also available from [GitHub actions].
