# Deploy your first JupyterLite website on GitHub Pages

```{hint}
If you first want to get familiar with the interface, check out the [User Guide](./using.md).
```

JupyterLite can easily be deployed on [GitHub Pages], using the `jupyterlite` CLI to add
content and extensions.

```{note}
Deploying to GitHub Pages requires a Github account.
```

## Generate a new repository from the template

The [jupyterlite demo] repository is a template to easily:

- build a JupyterLite website using prebuilt JupyterLite assets bundling a collection of
  pre-existing Jupyter Notebooks as part of the distribution
- deploy the website to GitHub Pages

The process is automated using Github Actions.

Click on "Use this template" to generate a repository of your own from this template:

![an animated gif to show how to use the provide repo template to generate a new website](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21197331/125816904-5768008a-77de-4cb3-8013-f3999b135c02.gif)

From the _Actions_ tab on your repository, ensure that workflows are enabled. When you
make a commit to the `main` branch, a Github Action will build your JupyterLite release
and deploy it to the repository's Github Pages. By default, the Github Pages site will
be found at `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY-NAME`. _You can also check
the URL from the Repository `Settings` tab `Pages` menu item._

If the deployment failed, go to "Settings - Actions - General", in the "Workflow
permissions" section, check "Read and write permissions". Check that you have Github
Pages enabled for your repository: from your repository _Settings_ tab, select the
_Pages_ menu item and ensure that the source is set to `GitHub Actions`:

When you commit a file, an updated website will be built and published on Github Pages.

```{note}
Note that it may take a few minutes for the Github Pages site to be updated. Do a hard
refresh on your Github Pages site in your web browser to see the new version of the
website.
```

```{note}
Alternatively, you can use the [JupyterLite demo using xeus-python](https://github.com/jupyterlite/xeus-python-demo) to publish a deployment on Github pages that uses xeus-python by default and allows to pre-install packages using ``emscripten-forge`` and ``conda-forge``.
```

## Accessing the JupyterLite website

After the build has completed, the site will be available on GitHub Pages. Go to
`https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY-NAME` to access it:

```{note}
By default the deployment provided by the `jupyterlite/demo` repo includes a `.nojekyll` file
to bypass Jekyll processing on GitHub Pages.

See this [blog post](https://github.blog/2009-12-29-bypassing-jekyll-on-github-pages/) for more information.
```

## Deploy a new version of JupyterLite

To change the version of the prebuilt JupyterLite assets, update the `jupyterlite-core`
package version in the `requirements.txt` file.

Commit and push the changes. The site will be deployed on the next push to the `main`
branch.

## Add additional requirements to the deployment

````{note}
The [jupyterlite/demo](https://github.com/jupyterlite/demo) repository uses a `requirements.txt` file to specify the dependencies. For demo purposes this file may contain extra kernels and extensions you might want to remove from your deployment. If that's the case you can stick to a more minimal `requirements.txt` file such as:

```bash
# core package for building the JupyterLite website
jupyterlite-core==0.1.0b19
# the Python kernel powered by Pyodide
jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel==0.0.5
# dependency for indexing the content
jupyterlab~=3.5.3
```
````

### Extensions

The `requirements.txt` file can be used to add extra prebuilt (also called _federated_)
JupyterLab extensions to the deployed JupyterLite website. Follow the
[extension guide](../howto/configure/simple_extensions.md) to learn more.

### Using the xeus-python kernel and emscripten-forge

Using
[a JupyterLite deployment with xeus-python](https://github.com/jupyterlite/xeus-python-demo),
you can pre-install packages available both on `conda-forge` and `emscripten-forge` by
specifying them to the `environment.yml` file.

By pre-installing packages, they are readily usable in the kernel and can be imported
without the need for `piplite`.

### Contents

You can add and update the default notebooks and files by clicking on the `contents`
directory and dragging notebooks from your desktop onto the contents listing. Wait for
the files to be uploaded and then save them (commit them) to the `main` branch of the
repository.

Check out the how-to guide on [managing content](../howto//content/files.md) to learn
more.
