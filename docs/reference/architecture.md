# Architecture

Below is a diagram showing a high level architecture overview of JupyterLite.

It focuses on the "server" part of JupyterLite and the fact that it is built using the
Lumino plugin system, just like JupyterLab itself. But It doesn't show the internals of
JupyterLab, RetroLab, and the several kernels.
