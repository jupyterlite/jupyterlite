JupyterLite is a JupyterLab distribution that **runs entirely in the browser** built
from the ground-up using JupyterLab components and extensions.

## ‚ö° Status ‚ö°

Although JupyterLite is currently being developed by core Jupyter developers, the
project is still _unofficial_.

Not all the usual features available in JupyterLab and the Classic Notebook will work
with JupyterLite, but many already do!

Don't hesitate to check out the
[documentation](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/howto/index.html) for more
information and project updates.

## ‚ú® Try it in your browser ‚ú®

JupyterLite works with both [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) and
[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook).

## üèóÔ∏è Build your own JupyterLite üèóÔ∏è

You can build your own JupyterLite website in a couple of minutes, with custom
extensions and packages.

See the
[documentation](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart/deploy.html) for
more details.

### Browser-based Interactive Computing

JupyterLite is all about accessible browser-based interactive computing:

- Python kernel backed by [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) running in a Web Worker
  - Initial support for interactive visualization libraries such as `altair`, `bqplot`,
    `ipywidgets`, `matplotlib`, and `plotly`
- JavaScript kernel running in a Web Worker
- View hosted example Notebooks and other files, then edit, save, and download from the
  browser's `IndexDB` (or `localStorage`)
- Support for saving settings for JupyterLab/Lite core and federated extensions
- Basic session and kernel management to have multiple kernels running at the same time
- Support for
  [Code Consoles](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/code_console.html)

### Ease of Deployment

- Served via well-cacheable, static HTTP(S), locally or on most static web hosts
- Embeddable within larger applications
- Requires no dedicated _application server_ much less a container orchestrator
- Fine-grained configurability of page settings, including reuse of federated extensions

JupyterLite is a reboot of several attempts at making a full static Jupyter distribution
that runs in the browser, without having to start the Python Jupyter Server on the host
machine.

The goal is to provide a lightweight computing environment accessible in a matter of
seconds with a single click, in a web browser and without having to install anything.

This project is a collection of packages that can be remixed together in variety of ways
to create new applications and distributions. Most of the packages in this repo focus on
providing server-like components that run in the browser (to manage kernels, files and
settings), so existing JupyterLab extensions and plugins can be reused out of the box.
